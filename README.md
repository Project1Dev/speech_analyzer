# Speech Mastery App

An iOS-based personal AI speech coach app that leverages server-backed AI analysis to enhance users' communication skills.

## Project Overview

This application helps users improve their speech patterns through:
- **Real-time audio recording** with privacy-first design
- **AI-powered speech analysis** detecting filler words, hedging, passive voice, and more
- **Personalized feedback** with daily reports and pattern recognition
- **Secure data handling** with encryption and auto-deletion

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: iOS app built with SwiftUI + Swift 5.9+
- **Backend**: FastAPI server with PostgreSQL database
- **AI Services**: Abstract interfaces for transcription and NLP analysis
- **Infrastructure**: Docker-based local development environment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- macOS with Xcode 15+ (for iOS development)
- Docker Desktop (for backend services)
- Python 3.11+ (for backend development)

### Quick Start

1. **Initialize development environment**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/*.sh
   ./scripts/setup.sh
   ```

2. **Start Docker services** (backend, database, cache):
   ```bash
   ./scripts/start-docker.sh
   ```

   Services will be available at:
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8000
   - API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - Database: localhost:5432
   - pgAdmin: http://localhost:5050

3. **Develop iOS app** (open in Xcode):
   ```bash
   open ios/SpeechMastery/SpeechMastery.xcodeproj
   ```

   Then select a `.swift` file and enable Canvas preview (Editor â†’ Canvas)
